To access on-chain transactions on the Ramelax platform, users are required to register their digital wallet. This essential step ensures a secure and compliant environment for all participants, enabling the seamless integration of blockchain technology within the bounds of legal requirements.


## How Wallet Registration Works?

Users will be prompted to link their digital wallet as part of our onboarding process. By registering their wallet, users confirm their identity and establish a direct connection between their wallet and the Ramelax platform. This allows us to facilitate on-chain transactions, secure user assets, and maintain a verified network of participants.

Only users who complete this wallet registration will be able to transact on-chain, which aligns with our commitment to legal compliance and regulatory standards.


## Why is Wallet Registration required?

Ramelax operates under a framework that prioritizes transparency and regulatory adherence, especially in financial markets where compliance is crucial. Wallet registration is a foundational step that fulfills multiple objectives:


- ### Regulatory Compliance

    By requiring all participants to register their wallets, Ramelax complies with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, which are critical to operating in regulated markets like Argentina's financial sector. This process minimizes the risk of fraud and ensures that all transactions adhere to legal standards.


- ### Enhanced Security

    Wallet registration adds a layer of security to our platform, linking each user's identity to their on-chain activities. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, creating a safer environment for transactions and asset custody.


- ### Transaction Traceability

    Registered wallets allow for real-time tracking of transactions, helping Ramelax maintain a transparent ledger of activity. This traceability benefits users, regulators, and the platform itself by providing a clear record of transactions and upholding a high standard of transparency.


- ### Efficient and Seamless Transactions

    Once a wallet is registered, users can access on-chain functionality for fast, secure, and compliant transactions. The registration process is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that users can engage in on-chain trading with minimal friction while remaining within regulatory guidelines.


## How to Register Your Wallet?

To register a wallet, users can simply go to their account settings and link an existing digital wallet by following the secure authentication prompts. Ramelax supports a range of wallet types, including popular options such as MetaMask, Ledger, and Trust Wallet. The registration process is straightforward and designed with user privacy in mind, providing a quick, secure link between the user's wallet and the Ramelax platform.
