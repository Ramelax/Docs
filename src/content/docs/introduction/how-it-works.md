### Asset Custody and Tokenization

Each asset on Ramelax is fully backed by real-world holdings, stored securely with our licensed custodian partners. For every digital token issued on our platform, there is a corresponding asset held 1:1, ensuring full transparency and investor confidence. This tokenization model offers fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy portions of assets previously limited to large investors only.
By leveraging blockchain, we simplify complex transactions and remove barriers, allowing investors to benefit from real-time trading, instant settlements, and automated processes that eliminate traditional inefficiencies. Our platform is built on security, compliance, and innovation, creating an environment where global investors can confidently participate in Argentina's high-potential economy.


### Dividend Distribution

Dividends are seamlessly distributed to token holders' wallets in stablecoins, providing immediate access to earnings as they are paid out. This automation enhances liquidity for investors, who can reinvest or withdraw dividends without delay, maximizing their financial flexibility.


### Regulatory Compliance

Our operations are underpinned by robust regulatory practices. Ramelax operates in full compliance with Argentine securities regulations, ensuring we meet both national and international standards for digital assets. With adherence to stringent regulations, our platform assures investors that their participation is safeguarded under Argentine law and international norms.
